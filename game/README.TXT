*********************************************************



A DirectX video game for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0


Special Note:

Make sure you have DirectX 2 or greater along with the
most current DirectX video card drivers installed on your
machine before playing the game.

DirectX is Microsoft's new game SDK for the development of
high performance Windows games.  If you do not have it
installed on your computer yet, check the Web for the 5 meg
downloadable version.  It's the wave of the future; if you
don't have it by now, then you'll have it very soon.

Game concept:

  DX-Ball is a 'breakout' game based on the popular Amiga game Megaball
  by Ed and Al Mackey.  It attempts to take the best aspects
  of Megaball and mixes them with a few fresh ideas.  A great deal
  of effort went into the game's "Amiga" look-and-feel.

  ( 60 frames per second animation, copper bars, sine scrollers,
  boing balls, dot flags, snappy game play, etc... )
 
  This game is kid-tested and mother-approved... don't be afraid to
  show this one to your non-computer buddies. :)



Game rules:

  Use your paddle to keep the ball(s) in the air.  Dropping all the
  balls in play will cause you to lose a paddle.  When all the
  paddles are lost, the game is over.  

  Break all the bricks on the screen to gain points and continue to
  the next board.  Catch blue bonuses for good options, red ones
  for bad options, and grey ones for mixed blessings.  See the title
  screen of the game for a complete table of bonuses and their
  function.

  Use the left mouse button to release the ball from the paddle when
  in grab mode.

  When the 'shooting paddle' bonus is caught, click the left mouse
  button to fire bullets at the bricks.



For you Amiga people:

  I'm that joker who wrote Scorched Tanks for the Amiga.  DX-Ball is
  the first complete PC game I've written.  STanks PC was on the way,
  but I landed a cool job in Chicago.  And yes, my wife is doing great!


  Read the scroller for juicy details about the creation of the game.



Question or comments:

  I'll be fielding e-mail at:

    MWELCH@NETWAVE.NET

  I can't promise a personal response to everyone's mail, but I do have
  a nifty form letter I'll send.  It has info about how to use the
  secret Level Editor, how to turn music on during the game, and maybe
  a cheat or two... if you ask for them.
               
  Feel free to send comments, suggestions, and bugs.

  I wrote this game for the sole purpose of entertaining people.  
  DX-Ball free to the world.  I only ask for proof that people enjoy
  my work.  There will be updates to DX-Ball based on the level of
  interest... so here's your chance to make a difference to a lowly
  game programmer.


  

Problems running DX-Ball:
-------------------------

  -If the ball jitters a lot during game play, then DX-Ball is in
   compatibility mode.  Check the intro screen for the reason for
   this mode.  Look under VIDEO CARD.

     -Video Memory is Low:  You have only 512k of video memory in
      your system or another application is using it.
     -Refresh Rate is Above 60mhz.  This app is built to use
      video cards that are timed to a 60 frames per second screen
      update.  Newer cards can go a lot faster, but the default
      is 60mhz.  If your card is too fast, look under DISPLAY in
      the CONTROL PANEL for the refresh rate setting.
     -No Hardware Acelleration: Your current DirectX video card
      drivers do not support hardware acelleration.  Either get newer
      drivers from the manufacturer (web site) or upgrade your
      system to a new card.

  -Video Cards that I personally tested with DX-Ball:
    S3 Trio32/64
    Stealth 3D 2000 (Virge chip)
    Matrox
    Tseng ET4000W32P
    Mach 32
    Cirrus Logic CD-GD5430 0
    Trident (no hardware)
    Bali 64 (no hardware)
